# Test Roadmap — OpenCart Manual UI Testing

## Goal

Ensure core UI functionality works for typical customer journeys and document behaviour clearly.

---

## Immediate tasks

### Phase 1 — Stabilise current coverage
- Review current test cases for consistency
- Label all tests clearly (POS / NEG)
- Add missing key paths (e.g., address validation)

### Phase 2 — Expand edge coverage
- Add more negative UI tests (invalid input combos)
- Include usability notes (layout differences, missing labels)

### Phase 3 — Cross-device checks
- Run important test cases on additional devices
- Note responsive layout issues

### Phase 4 — Reporting discipline
- Keep summary updated after every test cycle
- Log defect status changes clearly in `bug_reports/`
