# OpenCart Manual Testing Project (UI)

This repository holds a structured manual UI testing project for the OpenCart e-commerce platform.  
The goal was to show a QA-engineer-style approach to testing: planning, execution, reporting, and documenting issues.

Testing was done on a local OpenCart instance (XAMPP), with basic cross-browser checks in Chrome, Firefox and Edge.

## What’s included

- `test_cases/` – Manual UI test cases with clear steps, inputs and expected results.  
- `bug_reports/` – Logged issues discovered during testing with evidence. 
- Documentation files (this repo).  

## What was tested

Focus was on core user journeys:

- New user registration  
- Login & logout  
- Browsing products  
- Cart operations  
- Checkout process  

Both positive and negative flows were executed.

## How testing was done

- Manual execution of UI test cases  
- Data and results documented in Excel files  
- Defects logged with steps, expected vs actual, and screenshots  
- Cross-browser validation in major browsers

## Outcomes

66 manual test cases were executed.  
Most passed on the first run; a few failed due to negative/edge conditions.
